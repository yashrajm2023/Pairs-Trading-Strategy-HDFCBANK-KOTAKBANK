# Pairs-Trading-Strategy-HDFCBANK-KOTAKBANK

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a quantitative approach to pairs trading using historical price data from HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that exploits the relationship between two stocks when they become temporarily mispriced. By using statistical tests and Python programming, this project explores the dynamics of these stocks, identifies trading signals, and backtests the strategy.

Motivation
My interest in quantitative trading and financial markets drove me to explore pairs trading, a strategy well-suited for the volatile Indian stock market. This project allowed me to apply my skills in Python, statistics, and machine learning to real-world financial data.

Features
Data Fetching: Automatically fetches historical stock data using the yfinance API.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Includes correlation tests and visualizations to understand the relationship between the stocks.
Strategy Implementation: Implements the pairs trading strategy with clear, documented Python code.
Backtesting: Backtests the strategy to evaluate its effectiveness and profitability over the past data.
